# Assessments

<!-- UPDATE EACH TERM -->

Your overall course grade is composed of these weighted factors:

* Class Participation: 10%
* Weekly Assignments: 60%
* Projects: 30%

## Class Participation

Class participation is composed of your attendance in class, and your
submission of the weekly Guiding Question.

## Weekly Assignments

Each week you will be given an Assignment, where you'll practice the concepts
covered in the readings and lessons.  The assignments let you practice with the topics you cover that week, explore applications and connections, and check your own understanding of the material.

The assignments are completed within Gradescope, and they must be completed within two days of the live class session.

### Practice Problems

In addition to the Gradescope Assignments, you are provided with practice problems in your Anchor course material.  These practice problems sets are very valuable in that they will help you test your understanding of the material that you completed that week and ensure that you are ready to complete the assignment.  It is **highly** recommended that you complete as many of the Practice Problems as possible.  

## Project

Towards the end of the term, you will have a final project to complete.  You will be given multiple weeks to complete the project, and it will represent a significant portion (30%) of your final grade..
