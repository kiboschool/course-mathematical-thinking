# Assessments

<!-- UPDATE EACH TERM -->

Your overall course grade is composed of these weighted factors:

* Class Participation: 20%
* Weekly Assignments: 50%
* Projects: 30%

## Class Participation

Class participation is composed of your attendance in class, and your
submission of the weekly Guiding Question.

### Guiding Questions

Each week is guided by a question that prompts you to think and explore the central topic of the week. Your written answer will contribute to your participation grade.

### Instructions

* There is no right or wrong answer, feel free to explore the question your way
* You will need to do some external research to tackle these questions - cite your sources!

## Weekly Assignments

Each week you will be assigned a problem set, where you'll practice the concepts
covered in the readings and lessons.

Problem sets let you practice with the topics you cover that week, explore applications and connections, and check your own understanding of the material.

### Problem Set Instructions

* Submit your work in Gradescope
* Show your work. Direct answers will not be accepted.
* Each submission is worth 5% of your final grade, for a total of 50%.
* You may collaborate with your peers. If you do, include their names explicitly 
  in your submission (write something like "I collaborated with (names) on this 
  assignment" at the top of your submission)

Here's a video demonstrating how to submit your work in Gradescope:

## Projects

Approximately mid way through the term and in the final weeks of the term, you will be assigned projects, where you'll tie many concepts
together to the real world. These projects are summative in nature--this is your opportunity to demonstrate to the instructor that you understand what you are doing.  Note that these two projects make up a significant percentage of your final grade, so  it is critical that you begin the projects early.
