# Mathematical Thinking

**CSF004**
_6 ECTS Credits_

---

Is this statement true? why?

The course will revolve heavily around this recurring question. Across different mathematical topics, students will be faced with new statements to grapple with, and the techniques needed to tackle them.

This aims to be a contextualized course. We will write code on occasion, and introduce high-level mathematical challenges in computer science.

This course will help you develop the ability to think logically and mathematically, with an emphasis on logical reasoning and communicating using mathematics. In the unit on logic and proofs, you'll learn to identify, evaluate, and make convincing mathematical arguments.

You'll review number systems, and their relevance to digital computers. You'll discuss and practice algebraic operations and concepts fundamental to Computer Science. The course also includes an introduction to counting and probability.  You'll also explore how all of these methods are used in real-world computational problems.

## Meeting Times

* Class 1: Mondays from 3:00pm - 4:30pm GMT
* Class 2: Thursdays from 6:30pm - 8pm GMT
* Office Hours: Tuesdays 7:00pm - 8pm GMT & Fridays 7:00pm - 8pm GMT or by request.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
* Evaluate arguments, and identify the premises and conclusion of a mathematical argument 
* Create diagrams to graphically depict the structure of an argument 
* Decompose a given problem into smaller problems using recursion and induction
* Apply probability rules to determine the likelihood of an event

## Weekly Topics

## Assessments

Your overall course grade is composed of these weighted factors:

* Class participation: 20%
* Weekly assignments: 50%
* Projects: 30%

**Class participation** is composed of your attendance in class, and your
submission of the weekly Guiding Question.

**Weekly Assignments** are problem sets, where you'll practice the concepts
covered in the readings and lessons.

**Projects** are a Midterm and Final project, where you'll tie many concepts
together to the real world.

The weekly problem sets, guiding questions, midterm and final
projects are described on the next several pages.
