## Course Overview

Is this statement true? why?

The course will revolve heavily around this recurring question. Across different mathematical topics, students will be faced with new statements to grapple with, and the techniques needed to tackle them.

This aims to be a contextualized course. We will write code on occasion, and introduce high-level mathematical challenges in computer science.

This course will help you develop the ability to think logically and mathematically, with an emphasis on logical reasoning and communicating using mathematics. In the unit on logic and proofs, you'll learn to identify, evaluate, and make convincing mathematical arguments.

You'll review number systems, and their relevance to digital computers. You'll discuss and practice algebraic operations and concepts fundamental to Computer Science. The course also includes an introduction to counting and probability.  You'll also explore how all of these methods are used in real-world computational problems.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
* Evaluate arguments, and identify the premises and conclusion of a mathematical argument 
* Create diagrams to graphically depict the structure of an argument 
* Decompose a given problem into smaller problems using recursion and induction
* Apply probability rules to determine the likelihood of an event

## Topics

-  Propositional Logic
-  Introduction to Sets
-  Introduction to Proofs
-  Counting
-  Probability
-  Relations and Functions
-  Number Theory

## Assessments

Your overall course grade is composed of these weighted factors:

* 45% 	Problem Sets
* 20%	  Midterm Project
* 25%	  Final Project
* 10% 	Office Hours Attendance

**Problem Sets**  are chances to practice the concepts covered in the readings 
and lessons. 

The **Midterm Project** will be about Passwords, and connect mathematical theory 
to the real world.

The **Final Project** will be about Encryption.

The problem sets, midterm, and final projects will be completed and submitted 
using Gradescope.

**Office Hours** will be a chance to review the concepts and practice the
material together. You are required to attend at least 3 office hours sessions.
