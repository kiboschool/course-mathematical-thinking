# Sets

This week will focus on _sets_. Sets let mathematicians describe lots of things in the real world. When you know what kinds of operations you can do with sets, and what kinds of properties hold true, you can then apply those operations and properties to tons of specific situations and questions.

## Topics

- set notation
- empty set, subset, superset, power set
- union and intersection
- set builder notation
- number sets

## Resources:
- Section B1 from Introduction to Algorithms, Third edition.
