# Sets

This week will focus on _sets_. Sets let mathematicians describe lots of things in the real world. When you know what kinds of operations you can do with sets, and what kinds of properties hold true, you can then apply those operations and properties to tons of specific situations and questions.

## Guiding Question: Sets

To warm up your thinking about Sets, follow these steps.

1. Take a piece of paper and write the names of 10 people you know. Spread them around the page.
2. Now, try to draw a line around the names of all the people who:
  - Can prepare a nice meal.
  - You had a party with before.
  - You can beat in a race.
3. Answer these questions.
  - Were any of these categories empty?
  - Was anyone in all three categories?

Sets will have plenty of mathematical syntax and notation, but at the heart are
questions like these. Which elements are in the set? How many?
