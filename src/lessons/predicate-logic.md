# Predicate Logic

How do we know if an argument is sound? What are the rules around what kinds of statements we can make?

These lessons are focused on _predicate logic_: the rules that govern logical statements. You'll learn the mathematical notation for these rules, and start to formalize some of the kinds of logical statements you are used to making in your life when you speak.

You'll also practice evaluating chains of reasoning to verify that the reasoning is correct, or, if it's mistaken, locating which steps are invalid.
