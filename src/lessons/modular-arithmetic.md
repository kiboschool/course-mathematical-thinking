# Modular Arithmetic

Sometimes math that seems very abstract can have startling relevance in practical applications. Modular arithmetic lies firmly in that category.

The premise is simple: instead of operating on the natural numbers, what if we picked a subset of numbers, like { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, and defined addition so that it 'wrapped around', so 4 + 1 = 5, 4 + 2 = 1, and 4 + 3 = 2. Because 7 / 5 has the same remainder as 2 / 5, we call them _congruent_ (modulo 5).

At first glance, this seems almost... dumb. Why would you do that?

However surprising it may seem, definining operations on a 'group' like this is a central idea in number theory, and is applicable across computer science (especially cryptography), and in fields as diverse as law, chemistry, economics, and music.
