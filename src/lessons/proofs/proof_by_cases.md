# Proofs by cases

## Key Ideas:
- Defining the strategy for proofs by cases
- Showcasing examples of proofs by cases

## The argument's strategy:

Proof by cases are situationally very useful. In cases where the variables you use in your proof fall into distinct categories, you can show that your statement is correct for each categories separately. 

The way you prove each one of this subproofs can be independent from each other. You could prove one directly, and another by contrapositive. The key burden on you is to:
- Show that all your cases and categories make sense.
- Prove each correctly. 

Let's make this more concrete with an example we've seen before. Perhaps you've had an intuition for this alread!

	Show that if x and y are two integers whose product is even, then at least one of them is even. 

- Let's approach our proof directly. We assume that x and y are two integers such that xy is even. 
- In other words $xy = 2k$ for some integer k 
- Integers can be even or odd. This means we have 2 cases:

- **Case 1: x is even:**
- Assume $x = 2n$ for some integer n.
- $)
- At least one of x and y 
- Case 2: x and y are both odd
- Case 3: x is even and y is odd *(Note that this is equivalent to x being odd and y being even as multiplication does not care for order.)*

From now on. Proofs will become a mainstay of our course. We will cover at least one new one in class and problem sets each coming week, and introduce a few more tips and tricks as we go.
