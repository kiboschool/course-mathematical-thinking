# Probability

I've chosen a secret number between 1 and 100.

How likely is it that you can guess the number in one try? What about ten tries? What if you knew that I was more likely to pick an odd number?

Probability is about the chances that an event happens. These lessons will focus on the rules you can use to prove statements about events that aren't certain.

## Topics

- Definitions: events, randomness and uncertainty
- Probability spaces, sets, and distributions
- Conditional probability

## Guiding Question: Probability

Some probabilites are pretty easy to deduce intuitively. How likely is it that when you flip a coin, it lands on tails? Over the course of next week, we will practice techniques to make it simple for us to compute more complex probabilities. Let's warm up with a question about celebration!

- How likely do you think it is that you share a birthday with one of your classmates?
- How likely do you think it is that two of your classmates share a birthday with each other?

If you are comfortable with it, this would be a great opportunity to share your birthday on a class calendar so we can confirm if our math makes sense. Who knows, we might just figure out that we will have a large party in a few weeks!
