# Proofs

You've seen how we can use mathematical notation to represent logical arguments. Now, we'll turn our focus to specific kinds of arguments: proofs.

Outside of math, 'proof' means evidence, a trail of footprints that indicates the truth. In math, a proof is a kind of argument that convinces us about the truth of a mathematical statement. Because math lets us be precise about the way our terms are defined, we can be certain about mathematical proofs in ways we can't ever be quite certain about 'proof' in the rest of our lives.

These lessons will focus on some typical patterns for proving statements, and introduce the _quantifier_ notation for forming statements that apply _all_ of the time or _some_ of the time.

## Topics

- Quantifiers
- Proof by contradiction
- Direct proofs
- Indirect proofs
- Proof by contrapositive

## Guiding Question: Proofs

Another field that, like mathematics, uses precise and logical reasoning, is *law*. 

If a jury is to establish whether someone is innocent or guilty, legal teams have a burden to make **strong, convincing arguments.** These arguments often translate to very dramatic scenes in movies and TV shows which, I will confess, I am a huge fan of. We can learn a thing or two from them nevertheless! 

Take a look at the following clips:
 1. [In this first clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu6eR1Htq74&ab_channel=ABC), what are they key arguments put forward by the lawyer? are you convinced by his reasoning?
 2. [In this second clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubje-xA3H9g&ab_channel=maria), focus on the first 30 seconds of the argument shared. Is it convincing to you? how does it differ from the prior clip?

Proofs are about formal, mathematical arguments. They are a different type of
argument from the ones lawyers make! We use symbols instead of dressing in a suit and tie. But, some common points remain: we have to learn to follow a set of rules in order to make an airtight case.
