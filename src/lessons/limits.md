# Limits

This course has focused on proving statements, mostly about discrete sets of numbers.

In this final chapter, we'll discuss _limits_, which are a fundamental tool in the toolbox for proving statements for continuous sets, like the real number line. Limits are also the backbone of Calculus. We won't cover those topics in depth, but instead draw a faint preview of the connection between the topics in this course, and the topics you might encounter in other courses.

We care about limits because they help us think about what happens to functions across all cases - not just a few carefully chosen ones. This is particularly important when we're evaluating how fast a program will run, or how much space it will take up, given different inputs.
