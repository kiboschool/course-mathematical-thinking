# Counting

One of the first things you learn as a child is how to count. Questions about "how many" are fundamental to how mathematicians think about numbers.

In these lessons, we'll focus on counting elements of sets, in different ways. How many possible combinations of toppings are there for your pizza? How many different possibilities exist for the end of season rankings for a sports league? How many distinct passwords are possible, given a set of rules?
