# Number Systems

So far, all of the numbers we've dealt -- even numbers that don't have a fractional part -- with have been represented in the _decimal_ system. Each digit in a number that we write down contributes to the total based on it's _place value_. So, the number 234 is 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 4 * 1.

Each position in a decimal number has a place value 10^n. But... we don't have to use 10 for the place values. We could use some other number!

These lessons will explore number systems and representation. You'll focus on common number systems like decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), and hexadecimal (base 16), since those show up frequently in applications.

This week, you'll also revisit exponents and logarithms. These functions tend to be very helpful in programming in general, but especially when dealing with different bases. Exponents and logarithms will also give you a chance to practice proving different statements about numbers.
