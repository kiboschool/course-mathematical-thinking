# Elementary Functions

Throughout our education we have encountered several functions that turn up over and over throughout many math courses taken in the past, such as multiplication and addition.

These lessons are set to review a few of their properties.

You will be able to identify linear functions, affine functions, polynomials, exponentials and logarithms, as well as being able to manipulate them through the use of their specific properties.
