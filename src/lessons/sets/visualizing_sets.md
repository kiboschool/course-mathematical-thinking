# Reasoning with sets

## Key Ideas:
- Introducing Venn Diagrams

## Visualizing Sets:
We've introduced a lot of notation so let's take a moment and consolidate all of this by using visual aids. You will encounter Venn diagrams during your study of sets.

![3-set venn diagram](/images/three-set-empty.svg)

You can easily express the various operations we showed in the previous section. Here is an intersection:

![\\(A \cap B\\)](/images/two-set-cap.svg)

And here is a substraction:

![\\(A \setminus B\\)](/images/two-set-a-minus-b.svg)

How would you express the relationship between the three sets displayed in this diagram?

Take at least 3 minutes to think through it - what did you find?

There are a few different ways to express the relationship here, but the simples we could think of is: \\((B \cap C) \cup (C \cap \bar A)\\). Is it equivalent to what you found?
