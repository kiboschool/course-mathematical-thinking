# Review and Preview

This week will be a review of what you've learned so far, and a preview of how it connects to other branches of computer science and mathematics.

There won't be a regular problem set or weekly question this week. Instead, you'll spend time finishing up any previous work, reflecting on what you've learned, and looking ahead to other topics.

## Future Topics

### Limits

Limits are a fundamental tool in the toolbox for proving statements for continuous sets, like the real number line. Limits are also the backbone of Calculus. We care about limits because they help us think about what happens to functions across all cases - not just a few carefully chosen ones. This is particularly important when we're evaluating how fast a program will run, or how much space it will take up, given different inputs.
