# Functions and Relations

We can relate numbers to other numbers in tons of different ways. You've been using relations and functions to 'get from' one set of numbers to another for a while: every time you see an expression like `x + 7` or `sin(y)`, that's a _function_. The `x` and `y` are the input of the function, and the `+ 7` or `sin()` tell you how to get to the output.

In the next few lessons, you'll learn more about the rules of functions and relations, and how we can prove statements about them.

## Topics

- definitions: functions, relations, domain, codomain, and range
- function composition
- the 'jections: injection, surjection, bijection (one-to-one, onto, and invertible)
- pigeonhole principle

# Guiding Question: Functions and Relations

We have been able to solve so many day-to-day problems using computers. Many of these problems fundamentally are about transformation: Taking some input, and turning it into some new, more useful output.

Take a look at the following three links: [https://www.unitconverters.net](https://www.unitconverters.net/), [https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg), and [https://convertio.co/ocr](https://convertio.co/ocr/).

Take some time and test each of these tools.

- For each of the tools linked, what kind of input do they expect to receive? what kind of output do they produce?
- Make a guess as to how each one of them could be working.
- Based on that guess, do you think it's possible to go the other way around? In other words, use the output to produce the input, somehow?
