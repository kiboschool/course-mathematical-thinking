# Exponents and Logarithms

Certain functions tend to show up a lot in programming, because they tend to be really useful. This week, we'll focus on exponents and logarithms. These functions have a number of cool properties you'll explore.

One of the reasons exponents and logs are so powerful is that they offer a compact way to represent numbers: 2^32 is much easier to deal with than 4294967296, even if they are two different representations of the same number.

Exponents and logarithms will also give you a chance to practice proving different statements about numbers.
