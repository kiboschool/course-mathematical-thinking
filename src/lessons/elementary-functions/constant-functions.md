# Constant Functions

## Key Ideas:
- Define constant functions
- Establish graphical properties of constant functions

## Constant functions in one variable

As its name suggests, a constant function is a function whose output is constant independent of the input. When we graph a constant function in one variable on the cartesian plane we obtain a horizontal line.

In applications constant functions usually correspond to some form of initial condition, such as the principal in an investment, or an initial cost of production.

## Constant functions in two or more variables
When considering constants as functions of two variables we will see that their graph would correspond to just a horizontal plane that cuts the z-axis at the number that the constant represents.
