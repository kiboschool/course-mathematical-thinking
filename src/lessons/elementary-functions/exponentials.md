# Introduction to Exponential Functions

## Introduction
Exponential functions play a fundamental role in mathematics and are widely used in various fields, including science, finance, and computer science. We will explore the basics of exponential functions, their properties, and how to work with them.

## What is an Exponential Function?
An exponential function is a mathematical function of the form \\(f(x) = a^x\\), where \\(a\\) is a positive constant and \\(x\\) is a variable. The **base** \\(a\\) is typically greater than 1, but it can also be a number between 0 and 1, excluding 0. The variable \\(x\\) can be any real number or even a complex number. Even though many of the facts that we will expose also hold for exponentials with complex number values we will mainly focus on the variable taking real inputs.

## Properties of Exponential Functions

### Growth or Decay 

Exponential functions can represent both growth and decay phenomena. When the base \\(a\\) is greater than 1, the function exhibits **exponential growth**. Conversely, when 'a' is between 0 and 1, excluding 0, the function exhibits **exponential decay**.

### Domain and Range
The domain of an exponential function is the set of all real numbers. The range depends on whether the function base is or is not 1. If the base of the exponential function is different than 1, then the range is all positive real numbers. If the base of the exponential function is 1, then the range is just the set \\(\{1\}\\).

### Continuous Growth 
Exponential functions exhibit continuous growth or decay, meaning that they change gradually over time rather than in discrete steps.

### Asymptote 
Exponential functions have a horizontal asymptote, which is a line that the function approaches but never reaches. The asymptote is typically \\(y = 0\\) for growth functions when approching \\(-\infty\\) and \\(y = 0\\) for decay functions when approching \\((+)\infty\\).

### Additive property of Exponents

Probably the most important property of exponential functions, and in fact one of its defining characteristics, is that it opens up sums into products. Namely

- \\(f(x + y) = f(x) f(y) \\)

This property bears a lot of interesting facts about exponentials, including some of the following:

- \\(f(0) = 1\\) or \\(f(0) = 0\\) but we will not deal with the \\(f(0)=0\\) case since:

-  If \\(f(0) = 0\\) then \\(f(x)= 0\\) for all \\(x\\)

- \\(f(-x) = \frac{1}{f(x)}\\)


## Common Applications:

Exponential functions have numerous applications in various fields. Some common applications include:

- Population growth and decay
- Compound interest and investments
- Radioactive decay
- Biological processes
- Epidemic modeling
- Electronics and signal processing
