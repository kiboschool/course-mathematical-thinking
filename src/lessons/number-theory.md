# Number Theory

As you've seen, studying numbers can lead to powerful insights. Number theory is the study of the properties of numbers. While it might seem abstract at first glance, it turns out to have tons of useful applications, and yields lots of insight about what numbers can do.

We'll focus on some of the basics of number theory: what it means for a number to be divisible by another, the greatest common divisor (GCD), and the definitions of primes and coprimes. We'll also discuss simple but powerful algorithms: Euclid's algorithm for finding the GCD, and the Sieve of Eratosthenes for generating primes.

## Topics

- Divisibility
- Number Systems
- GCD and Euclid's algorithm
- Primes, primality testing, and prime sieves
- Relative primes
- Extended Euclidean algorithm
- Congruences
- Diophantine equations

# Guiding Question: Number Systems

At this point we know that we can represent arbitrary numbers in binary form, but you don't spend your time online looking purely at numbers right? You read text, watch videos, listen to music, play games, and so many other interactions.

Pick one form of media of your choice, and explore how fundamentally, that data is codified as a series of numbers by computers. For example, it might be a good start to look at how color is stored, or images, but it's up to you ultimately what media you pick.

Share what you found, and any questions it sparks for you.
