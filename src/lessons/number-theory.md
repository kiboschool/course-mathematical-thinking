# Number Theory

As you've seen, studying numbers can lead to powerful insights. Number theory is the study of the properties of numbers. While it might seem abstract at first glance, it turns out to have tons of useful applications, and yields lots of insight about what numbers can do.

We'll focus on some of the basics of number theory: what it means for a number to be divisible by another, the greatest common divisor (GCD), and the definitions of primes and coprimes. We'll also discuss simple but powerful algorithms: Euclid's algorithm for finding the GCD, and the Sieve of Eratosthenes for generating primes.
