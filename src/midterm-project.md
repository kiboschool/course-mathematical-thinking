# How good is a P@ssword?

## Intro

How many passwords do you have? It could be dozens! You certainly use at least that many platforms... but you may reuse your passwords between sites.

Passwords give you access to your social circle through social media, information about your work and studies, and even your finances.

Have you ever used a password that was your name? What about a family memberâ€™s name? Or something like P@ssword or 12345? If you're curious, you can look for your passwords on [https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) to see if they have already leaked to networks of hackers.

(Kibo recommends using a password manager - you can revisit this section of the laptop setup guide in case you aren't using one already: [laptop setup guide - password manager](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides/blob/main/academic-software.md#password-manager))

The aim of this project is to walk us through the logic behind generating passwords, develop intuition for how they are often attacked and what we can do about it, as well as ways to store them safely.

By the end of this project, you will have compared different password schemes, you will also calculate the efficacy of various attacks on those schemes, and you will apply your theoretical understanding of sets, probabilities, and relations to figure out how to best store these passwords.

## Instructions

The project has 3 parts:
<!-- This is what should be published when the course begins. We can swap to the version with urls once we reach week 4
- Part 1: Password Generation
- Part 2: Attacking Passwords
- Part 3: Storing Passwords
 -->
- [Part 1: Password Generation](1-password-generation.md)
- [Part 2: Attacking Passwords](2-attacking-passwords.md)
- [Part 3: Storing Passwords](3-storing-passwords.md)

Each part will involve applying a different set of mathematical concepts you've learned.

## Deadlines

This is a multi-week project.

You have until Nov 21 to finish all of the required parts of the project.

You are expected to submit your work by these deadlines:
- Nov 7: Part 1
- Nov 14: Part 2
- Nov 21: Finished Project (all three parts)

Your answers will only be scored after the finished project deadline. You are encouraged to revisit your answers to Part 1 and Part 2 if you think you can improve them.

You have access to the entire project now, but we have not have covered all the topics yet. Plan to revisit the project each week as you learn the skills required to solve each part of the challenge.

Other Notes:
- For questions that require you to perform calculations, make sure to show your work.
- For questions that ask you for a hypothesis or opinion, we do not expect a ***correct*** answer. Feel free to share your genuine thoughts, and we will revisit them later through the exercise.

## Submission

Create a separate answers file for each part of the project: 1-answers.md, 2-answers.md, 3-answers.md.

Answer the questions and prompts from that part of the project in that file. To submit your work, commit and push your files to the github repository for the project. If it's helpful, you can also add other files to the repository (like photos or scans) if they are helpful for answering the prompts.
