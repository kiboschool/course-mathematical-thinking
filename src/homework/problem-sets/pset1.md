Notes:
- Start early! Problem sets take time, and you may get stuck on some problems.
    Try to complete all that you can, then bring questions to office hours.
- You'll get feedback on some of your answers in Gradescope when you submit.
    Review your answers and resubmit to get full points. As you do, try to
    figure out why your original answer wasn't correct.
