## Problems
![problem 1](/images/week6_p1.svg)

1. Consider the function \\(f: \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \to \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) represented in the graph above:
   1. is *f* injective? explain
   2. is *f* surjective? explain

2. In the game of hearts, 4 players are given 13 cards from a deck of 52 typical playing cards. 
   1. Represent this as a function, stating its domain and codomain.
   2. Is this function injective?
   3. Is this function surjective?

3. Let \\(S = \\{\frac{p}{q}: p, q \in \mathbb Z, q \neq 0\\}\\) be the set of fractions. We define a relation *R* on *S* such by the formula: \\(\frac{a}{b} R \frac{c}{d} \iff ad = bc\\). Is R an equivalence relation? why or why not?

4. Consider the following function: \\(f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N\\) described as \\(f(n+1) = \begin{cases}\frac{f(n)}{2}\quad  if\\;  f(n)\\;  is\\;  even \\\ 3f(n) + 1 \quad if \\; f(n) \\; is\\;  odd \end{cases}
\\)

Notice that if f(0) = 1, we get that: f(1) = 4, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 4, etc. So we have a cycle.


   1. if f(0) = 5, can f be injective? Explain why or give a specific example of two elements from the domain with the same image.
   2. if f(0) = 3, can f be injective? Explain why or give a specific example of two elements from the domain with the same image.
   3. show that no matter the initial value, f can not be surjective.
