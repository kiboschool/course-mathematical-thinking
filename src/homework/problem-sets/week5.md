## Problems


1. We flip a coin three times. The set of all outcomes can be described as:
\\(\omega = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, TTT, TTH, THH, THT}\\)
For each of the following events which are subests of \\(\omega\\), describe the event in english, then compute the probability of it occuring:
  - \\(\E_1 = {HHH, TTT}\\)
  - \\(\E_2 = {HHT, THH, HTH}\\)
  - \\(\E_3 = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT}\\)
2. If A, B, and C are three events, show that:
\\(P( A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(B \cap C) - P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B \cap C)\\)

3. From a deck of five cards numbered 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively, a card is drawn at random and replaced. This is done three times. What is the probability that the card numbered 2 was drawn exactly two times, given that the sum of the numbers on the three draws is 12?

4. One coin in a collection of 65 has two heads. The rest are fair. If a coin, chosen at random from the lot and then tossed, turns up heads 6 times in a row, what is the probability that it is the two-headed coin? 

5. You are given two urns and fifty balls. Half of the balls are white and half are black. You are asked to distribute the balls in the urns with no restriction placed on the number of either type in an urn. How should you distribute the balls in the urns to maximize the probability of obtaining a white ball if an urn is chosen at random and a ball drawn out at random? Justify your answer.
