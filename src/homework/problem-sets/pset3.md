## Submission

- You may collaborate with up your peers. If you do, be sure to mention who you 
  collaborated with explicitly in your submission. For example, write "I worked
  with Ope and Mehdi on this problem set" at the top.

Submit your answers in the Gradescope Assignment.


### Notes
- Start early! Problem sets take time, and you may get stuck on some problems.
    Try to complete all that you can, then bring questions to office hours.
- You'll get feedback on some of your answers in Gradescope when you submit.
    Review your answers and resubmit to get full points. As you do, try to
    figure out why your original answer wasn't correct.
