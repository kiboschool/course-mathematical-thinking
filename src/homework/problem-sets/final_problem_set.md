## Problems

1. Perform the following conversions:
    1. 27 in base 10 to base 2
    2. 1111111 in base 2 to base 10
    3. 101 in base 10 to base 2
2. Compute GCD(1240, 6660)
3. Let *a* be a positive integer. Prove that GCD(*a*, *a*+1) = 1
4. Prove that GCD(*a*, *a+2*) = 1 if *a* is odd, and GCD(*a*, *a+2*) = 2 if *a* is even
5. Show that if \\(a \equiv b (\text{mod n})\\) and if \\(b \equiv c (\text{mod n})\\), then \\(a \equiv c (\text{mod n})\\)
6. Simplify the following congruences:
    1. \\(15x \equiv 9 \text{ (mod 25)}\\)
    1. \\(6x \equiv 3 \text{ (mod 9)}\\)
    1. \\(14x \equiv 42 \text{ (mod 50)}\\)
7. Describe the general solution for *x* and *y*, if it exists: \\(35x + 47y = 1\\)
