## Problems

1. Perform the following conversions:
    1. 27 in base 10 to base 2
    2. 1111111 in base 2 to base 10
    3. 101 in base 10 to base 2
2. Compute GCD(1240, 6660)
3. Let *a* be a positive integer. Prove that GCD(*a*, *a*+1) = 1
4. Prove that GCD(*a*, *a+2*) = 1 if *a* is odd, and GCD(*a*, *a+2*) = 2 if *a* is even
5. Show that if $a \equiv b (\text{mod n})$ and if $b \equiv c (\text{mod n})$, then $a \equiv c (\text{mod n})$
6. Simplify the following congruences:
    1. $15x \equiv 9 \text{ (mod 25)}$
    1. $6x \equiv 3 \text{ (mod 9)}$
    1. $14x \equiv 42 \text{ (mod 50)}$
7. Describe the general solution for *x* and *y*, if it exists: $35x + 47y = 1$
