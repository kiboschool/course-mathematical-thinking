## Instructions:

1. Prove the following statements:
   1. Given that \\( \forall x, F(x) \lor G(x)\\) and \\(\lnot \exists x G(x)\\), conclude that \\(\forall x, F(x)\\)
   2. \\( \forall x (\lnot F(x) \lor G(x)) \to \forall x (F(x) \to G(x))\\)
   3. \\( \lnot (\exists x F(x)) \iff \forall x \lnot F(x) \\)
   4. \\(\lnot (\forall x F(x)) \iff \exists x \lnot F(x) \\)
   5. \\(\exists x F(x) \iff \lnot (\forall x \lnot F(x)) \\)

2. Consider the statement: For all integers _n_, if _n_ is even then _8n_ is even. 
   1. Prove the statement. What kind of proof are you using?
   2. What is the converse of the statement?
   3. Prove or disprove the converse.

3. Prove the statement: For all integers _n_, if _5n_ is odd then _n_ is odd. Clearly state what kind of proof you are using.

4. Prove the statement: \\(x = y\\) if and only if \\(xy = \frac {(x+y)^2}{4}\\). 

    Note that you will need to prove both 'directions' of the implication.

5. Suppose you would like to prove the following implication: 

    "For all numbers *n*, if *n* is prime, then *n* is solitary"

   How would you *start* and *end* your argument if you tried to prove the statement...

   1. Directly
   2. By contradiction
   3. By contrapositive

   You do not have to actually prove the statement, as we haven't covered primes and solitary numbers. Focus on the structure of the argument.

6. A friend shows you the following proof that shows the statement 1 = 3:

   - Assume \\( 1 = 3 \\)
   - Therefore \\( 1 - 2 = 3 - 2 \\)
   - Simplifying we get \\( -1 = 1 \\)
   - \\( (-1)^2 = 1^2 \\)
   - \\( 1 = 1 \\) which is true
   - Therefore \\( 1 = 3 \\)
   
   Is this a valid argument? Does it prove the claim that \\( 1 = 3 \\)? explain in as much detail as possible.
