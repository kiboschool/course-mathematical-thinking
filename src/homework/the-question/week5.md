# Guiding Question: Week 5

Some probabilites are pretty easy to deduce intuitively. How likely is it that when you flip a coin, it lands on tails? Over the course of next week, we will practice techniques to make it simple for us to compute more complex probabilities. Let's warm up with a question about celebration!

- How likely do you think that you share a birthday with one of your classmates?
- How likely do you think that two of your classmates share a birthday with each other?

If you are comfortabe with it, this would be a great opportunity to share your birthday on a class calendar so we can confirm if our math makes sense, and who knows, we might just figure out that we will have a large party in a few weeks!
