## Instructions:
We have been able to solve so many day-to-day problems using computers. Many of these problems fundamentally are about transformation: Taking some input, and turning it into some new, more useful output. Take a look at the following three links: [link 1](https://www.unitconverters.net/), [link 2](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg), and [link 3](https://convertio.co/ocr/).
- Take some time and test each ofthese tools.
- For each of the tools linked, what kind of input do they expect to receive? what kind of output do they produce.
- Make a guess as to how each one of them could be working.
- Based on that guess, do you think it's possible to go the other way around? in other words, use the output to produce the input, somehow?
