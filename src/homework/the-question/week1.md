## Instructions:
One field that shares a surprising amount of commonality with mathematics, in terms of precise and logical reasoning, is *law*. If a jury is to establish that someone is innocent or guilty, the legal teams have a burden to make **strong, convincing arguments.** These arguments often translate to very dramatic scenes in movies and TV shows which I will confess, I am a huge fan of. We can learn a thing or two from them nevertheless! Take a look at the two following clips:
 1. [In this first clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu6eR1Htq74&ab_channel=ABC), what are they key arguments put forward by the lawyer? are you convinced by his reasoning?
 2. [In this second clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubje-xA3H9g&ab_channel=maria), focus on the first 30 seconds of the argument shared. Is it convincing to you? how does it differ from the prior clip?
