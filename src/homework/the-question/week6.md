## Instructions:
In the next few weeks, we will grapple with numbers more concretely as we transition from more theoretical topics. So let's try and quantify some concrete numbers that are relevant to our field. 

For example, you must be familiar with the term Megabyte and Gigabyte. Can you look up how many Gigabytes your laptop has? 

Now in your opinion, what is the largest video game ever created? by intuition, do you think it would fit in your hardrive right now? what if I told you it was a whopping 250 Gigabytes? 

What is a Gygabyte anyway? what's a byte?
