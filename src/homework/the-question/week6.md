# Guiding Question Week 8

We have been able to solve so many day-to-day problems using computers. Many of these problems fundamentally are about transformation: Taking some input, and turning it into some new, more useful output.

Take a look at the following three links: [https://www.unitconverters.net](https://www.unitconverters.net/), [https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg), and [https://convertio.co/ocr](https://convertio.co/ocr/).

Take some time and test each of these tools.

- For each of the tools linked, what kind of input do they expect to receive? what kind of output do they produce?
- Make a guess as to how each one of them could be working.
- Based on that guess, do you think it's possible to go the other way around? In other words, use the output to produce the input, somehow?
