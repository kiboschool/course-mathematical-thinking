# Guiding Question: Week 6

We have been able to solve so many day-to-day problems using computers. Many of these problems fundamentally are about transformation: Taking some input, and turning it into some new, more useful output.

Take a look at the following three links:

- [link 1](https://www.unitconverters.net/)
- [link 2](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg)
- [link 3](https://convertio.co/ocr/).


- Take some time and test each of these tools.
- For each of the tools linked, what kind of input do they expect to receive? what kind of output do they produce?
- Make a guess as to how each one of them could be working.
- Based on that guess, do you think it's possible to go the other way around? In other words, use the output to produce the input, somehow?
