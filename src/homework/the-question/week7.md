## Instructions:
At this point we know that we can represent arbitrary numbers in binary form, but you don't spend your time online looking purely at numbers right? You read text, watch videos, listen to music, play games, and so many other interactions. 

Pick one form of media of your choice, and explore how fundamentally, that data is codified as a series of numbers by computers. For example, it might be a good start to look at how color is stored, or images, but it's up to you ultimately what media you pick. 

Share what you found, and any questions it sparks for you.
