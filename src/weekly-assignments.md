# Weekly Assignments

Throughout the course, you will be expected to perform two tasks weekly:
- A problem set will be released halfway through each week covering that week's content. You can find the weekly problem sets [here](homework/problem-sets/overview.md)
- A short, open-ended research question will be released at the end of each week. You can find all the questions [here](homework/the-question/overview.md)
