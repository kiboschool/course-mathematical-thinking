## Problem Sets

Problem sets let you practice with the topics you cover that week, explore 
applications and connections, and check your own understanding of the material.

### Problem Set Instructions

- Submit your work in Gradescope
- Show your work. Direct answers will not be accepted.
- Each submission is worth 15% of your final grade, for a total of 45%.
- You may collaborate with your peers. If you do, include their names explicitly 
  in your submission (write something like "I collaborated with (names) on this 
  assignment" at the top of your submission)

## Projects

You will also be responsible for a Midterm Project and Final Project. Each is a
substantial, practical application of the topics and theory in the course.

The Midterm Project counts for 20% of your final grade. TheFinal Project counts
for 25%.

You are expected to work independently on the midterm and final project. If you
get stuck or have a question, you should ask in the public Discord help channel
for the course, or attend office hours for assistance.
