# Weekly Assignments

Throughout the course, you will be expected to perform two tasks weekly:
- A problem set will be released halfway through each week covering that week's content.
- A short, open-ended research question will be released at the end of each week.

You'll also have two larger projects, described on their own pages.

You can find the instructions and links to each week's work below.

## Problem Sets

Problem sets let you practice with the topics you cover that week, explore applications and connections, and check your own understanding of the material.

### Problem Set Instructions

-  You may collaborate with up to 1 peer. If you do, include their name explicitly in your submission.
-  Show your work. Direct answers will not be accepted.
-  Each submission is worth 5% of your final grade, for a total of 45%.

## Guiding Questions

Each week is guided by a question that prompts you to think and explore the central topic of the week. Your written answer will contribute to your participation grade.

### Instructions

- There is no right or wrong answer, feel free to explore the question your way
- You will need to do some external research to tackle these questions - cite your sources!
