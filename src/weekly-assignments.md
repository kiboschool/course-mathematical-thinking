# Problem Sets and Guiding Questions

Throughout the course, you will be expected to complete two tasks weekly:
- A problem set covering that week's content.
- A short, open-ended research question to ponder about the week's material.

You can find the instructions and links to each week's work below.

## Problem Sets

Problem sets let you practice with the topics you cover that week, explore applications and connections, and check your own understanding of the material.

### Problem Set Instructions

- Submit your work in Gradescope
- Show your work. Direct answers will not be accepted.
- Each submission is worth 5% of your final grade, for a total of 50%.
- You may collaborate with your peers. If you do, include their names explicitly 
  in your submission (write something like "I collaborated with (names) on this 
  assignment" at the top of your submission)

Here's a video demonstrating how to submit your work in Gradescope:

### Problem Set Index

Problem Set 0 is a chance to practice submitting work on Gradescope. It is intended
to be quite easy, and will not be scored.

Note that Problem Set 0 and Problem Set 1 are both due in Week 1. You should
submit Problem Set 0 as soon as possible, to confirm that you are properly set
up for further submissions.

## Guiding Questions

Each week is guided by a question that prompts you to think and explore the central topic of the week. Your written answer will contribute to your participation grade.

### Instructions

- There is no right or wrong answer, feel free to explore the question your way
- You will need to do some external research to tackle these questions - cite your sources!

### Guiding Question Index

Each week will have a guiding question released the prior week, to help prime your thinking about the topic.

The questions will be linked here when each week's lessons are published.
