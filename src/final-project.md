# Can you keep a secret?

## Intro:

Do you have secrets? crucial information that only a select few should be aware of? if so then this lab is for you. We saw that hashes can help us turn some information - for example a password - into a different form, but this transformation is a “one way street”: it’s very hard, if not impossible, to figure out the original information from the hash. 

Encryption algorithms will also transform data, but with a clear way to get the original data back. In other words: If we have an original message *m,* we can create an encrypted message *c* which can be deciphered back to *m* with another algorithm called a decryption algorithm. There are many techniques for encryption, some of which date thousands of years. This lab will apply the content we recently learned to discuss and analyse encryption strategies, and build up to an understanding of RSA, one of the most commonly used encryption algorithms today.

## Instructions:

<!-- 
This is what should be shown to the students initially. We publish the linked version when students reach the relevant content

The project has 3 parts:
- Part 1: Defining Encryption
- Part 2: Preparing for RSA
- Part 3: Proving RSA
 -->
The project has 3 parts:
- [Part 1: Defining Encryption](1-defining-encryption.md)
- [Part 2: Preparing for RSA](2-preparing-for-RSA.md)
- [Part 3: Proving RSA](3-proving-RSA.md)

Each part will involve applying a different set of mathematical concepts you've learned.

## Submission and Due Dates:
This is a multi-week project.

You have until Nov 21 to finish all of the required parts of the project.

You are expected to submit your work by these deadlines:

- Dec 5: Part 1
- Dec 12: Part 2
- Dec 19: Finished Project (all three parts)
Your answers will only be scored after the finished project deadline. You are encouraged to revisit your answers to Part 1 and Part 2 if you think you can improve them.

You have access to the entire project now, but we have not have covered all the topics yet. Plan to revisit the project each week as you learn the skills required to solve each part of the challenge.

Other Notes:

- For questions that require you to perform calculations, make sure to show your work.
- For questions that ask you for a hypothesis or opinion, we do not expect a correct answer. Feel free to share your genuine thoughts, and we will revisit them later through the exercise.
