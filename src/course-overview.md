## Office Hours

Office Hours will be held on **Wednesdays from 6:30pm-8pm GMT**, using Zoom.

> You are required to attend _at least 3 Office Hours sessions_. 
> Office Hours Attendance counts for 10% of your final grade. 

- Register for the office hours and add them to your calendar, so that you do
    not forget
- Bring questions to office hours. The discussion will be more helpful if you
    show up with topics that you are confused by, from the materials.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
* Evaluate arguments, and identify the premises and conclusion of a mathematical argument 
* Create diagrams to graphically depict the structure of an argument 
* Decompose a given problem into smaller problems using recursion and induction
* Apply probability rules to determine the likelihood of an event

## Topics

-  Propositional Logic
-  Introduction to Sets
-  Introduction to Proofs
-  Counting
-  Probability
-  Relations and Functions
-  Number Theory

## Assessments

Your overall course grade is composed of these weighted factors:

* 45% 	Problem Sets
* 20%	  Midterm Project
* 25%	  Final Project
* 10% 	Office Hours Attendance

**Problem Sets**  are chances to practice the concepts covered in the readings 
and lessons. 

The **Midterm Project** will be about Passwords, and connect mathematical theory 
to the real world.

The **Final Project** will be about Encryption.

The problem sets, midterm, and final projects will be completed and submitted 
using Gradescope.

**Office Hours** will be a chance to review the concepts and practice the
material together. You are required to attend at least 3 office hours sessions.
