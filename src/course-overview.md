## Assessments

Your overall course grade is composed of these weighted factors:

* 45% 	Problem Sets
* 20%	  Midterm Project
* 25%	  Final Project
* 10% 	Office Hours Attendance

**Problem Sets**  are chances to practice the concepts covered in the readings 
and lessons. 

The **Midterm Project** will be about Passwords, and connect mathematical theory 
to the real world.

The **Final Project** will be about Encryption.

The problem sets, midterm, and final projects will be completed and submitted 
using Gradescope.

**Office Hours** will be a chance to review the concepts and practice the
material together. You are required to attend at least 3 office hours sessions.
