# Academic Integrity

When you turn in any work that is graded, you are representing that the work is your own.
Copying work from another student or from an online resource (including generative AI tools like ChatGPT)
and submitting it is _plagiarism_.

As a reminder of Kibo's academic honesty and integrity policy: Any student found
to be committing academic misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action
including dismissal.

Disciplinary action may include:

- Failing the assignment
- Failing the course
- Dismissal from Kibo

integrity, review the ["What is Plagiarism?" Video](https://youtu.be/2qmWz7Qvh0E)
